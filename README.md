# bb-template-as-header
A Beaver Builder plugin which allows you to select any template (global row?) and inserts it before the BB header wrapped inside &lt;header> tags. 

The plugin 'Insert Page' is embedded within this plugin as it is modified to wrap the outputted page within header tags.

Just an experimentation but some people may find it useful if they want to use a BB layout to create their header
