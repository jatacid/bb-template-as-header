# bb-template-as-header
A Plugin which hooks into the Beaver Builder Theme Customizer, and allows you to select via a drop down menu - any saved template to use in place of a header or footer across the whole site.

The header has a custom ID called #custom-header. Use it for targeting any CSS styling.

The Footer has a custom ID called #custom-footer.

The plugin can be updated at any time, so like any plugins if you plan on using it for client work - make sure you have a backup before updating.

This utilises the new beaver builder shortcode to render layouts and requires the plugin version of 1.7.1 at least to function.  Otherwise you will see just an outputted shortcode.


Example:

Instructions:

1. Install & Activate plugin
2. Go into the BB-theme customizer
3. There is a new section added, go into it and click the drop down select box (seen above)
4. Select the name of the Global template that you have saved.
5. IF YOU DON'T SEE YOUR TEMPLATES: Go into your Beaver Builder settings and enable templates in the settings admin.
6. Save.

<<<<<<< HEAD
7. TURN OFF DEFAULT HEADER.
To turn off the default header/logo of the theme simply go to your header settings in the customizer and set header layout to 'none'.
8. TURN OFF DEFAULT FOOTER.
Same as the header, go into the 'footer' section of the customizer and set 'footer layout' to 'none'.

9. I left these options ON instead of turning them off for you so that you can control things in certain layouts.  Maybe you want to add a nice call to action on every page above the default footer.  Or maybe you want to add some location details and critical information on each page just below the header.

I don't plan on continuing much development for this but if you would like me to continue adding features then consider buying me a coffee <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=jatacid%40gmail%2ecom&lc=AU&item_name=Dentex%20Media&no_note=0&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted">Using my Paypal</a>.
