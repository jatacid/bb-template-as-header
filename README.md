# bb-template-as-header
A Beaver Builder plugin which allows you to select any template (global row?) and inserts it before the BB header wrapped inside &lt;header> tags. 

The plugin 'Insert Page' is embedded within this plugin as it is modified to wrap the outputted page within header tags.

Just an experimentation but some people may find it useful if they want to use a BB layout to create their header


This plugin is not going to be fleshed out.  It's just a proof of concept idea in making the Beaver Builder Plugin more of a 'Theme Builder' as opposed to just a page builder.  I don't intend to continue development, however if you'd like to see me put some time into it then feel free to leave a donation. I'll add a new feature or two!  https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=LTSU4D59G37G2
