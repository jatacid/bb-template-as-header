# bb-template-as-header
A Plugin which hooks into the Beaver Builder Theme Customizer, and allows you to select via a drop down menu - any saved template to use in place of a header or footer across the whole site.

The header has a custom ID called #custom-header. Use it for targeting any CSS styling.

The Footer has a custom ID called #custom-footer.

The plugin can be updated at any time, so like any plugins if you plan on using it for client work - make sure you have a backup before updating.

This utilises the new beaver builder shortcode to render layouts and requires the plugin version of 1.7.1 at least to function.  Otherwise you will see just an outputted shortcode.

I don't plan on continuing much development for this but if you would like me to continue adding features then consider buying me a coffee <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=jatacid%40gmail%2ecom&lc=AU&item_name=Dentex%20Media&no_note=0&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted">Using my Paypal</a>.
