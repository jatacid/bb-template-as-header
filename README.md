# bb-template-as-header
A Beaver Builder plugin which allows you to select any template and insert it before the BB header wrapped inside header tags.

And now also allows you to select a footer template as well. 

The header has a custom ID called #custom-header. Use it for targeting any CSS styling.

The Footer has a custom ID called #custom-footer.

The plugin has an update class with github so I can update it at any time - so if you want to use it for client work - then I suggest modifying it so that it won't get overridden.

This utilises the new beaver builder shortcode to render layouts and requires the plugin version of 1.7.1 at least to function.  Otherwise you will see just an outputted shortcode.

Instructions:

1. Install & Activate plugin
2. Go into the BB-theme customizer
3. There is a new section added, go into it and click the drop down select box (seen above)
4. Select the name of the Global template that you have saved.
5. IF YOU DON'T SEE YOUR TEMPLATES: Go into your Beaver Builder settings and enable templates in the settings admin.
