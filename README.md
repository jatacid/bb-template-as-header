# bb-template-as-header
A Beaver Builder plugin which allows you to select any template and insert it before the BB header wrapped inside header tags. 

The header has a custom ID called #custom-header. Use it for targeting any styling.

The plugin has an update class with github so I can update it at any time - so if you want to use it for client work - then I suggest modifying it so that it won't get overridden.

This utilises the new beaver builder shortcode to render layouts and requires the plugin version of 1.7.1 at least to function.  Otherwise you will see just an outputted shortcode.
